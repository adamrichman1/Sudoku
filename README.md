# Sudoku

Sudoku accepts an input sudoku board and uses a backtracking algorithm to automatically solve the sudoku puzzle. Errors are thrown where necessary and if the board has no solution, an appropriate message is displayed.

This project was created for my Data Structures class (CS0445) at the University of Pittsburgh.
